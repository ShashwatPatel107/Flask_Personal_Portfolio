Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is designed to showcase the projects that I have worked on, as well as provide information about my skills, experience, and interests.

I've taken care to create a clean and modern design that features easy-to-navigate sections highlighting my work and expertise. To build the website, I utilized Flask and Python, along with HTML/CSS/JS to create a responsive and visually appealing framework.

In addition, I have integrated my projects with a MySQL database for better upgradability and scalability. This allows me to easily update and add new projects to my portfolio as I continue to build my skills and experience.
