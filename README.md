# Flask-Powered Personal Portfolio Website

> A full-stack personal portfolio site powered by Flask and designed to showcase your professional profile, projects, and resume dynamically.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a backend-integrated personal portfolio using Python and Flask that enhances customization, data management, and interactive features beyond static HTML/CSS sites.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project is an extension of a static portfolio concept, upgraded with Flask to introduce dynamic content loading, templating, and backend logic. It allows you to manage your content more efficiently and prepare the site for future CMS or database integration.

The goal is to keep it modular, clean, and easy to deploy, while reflecting a polished professional brand.
